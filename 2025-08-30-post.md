## Introduction
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the rapidly evolving landscape of drug discovery, Artificial Intelligence (AI) co-folding models have gained significant attention, frequently highlighted in public reports for their potential to revolutionise structure-based drug design (SBDD). These computational tools promise to accelerate the identification and optimisation of novel drug candidates by predicting the intricate interactions and corresponding conformations between receptors and ligands, under induced fit effects. However, despite the widespread enthusiasm, there remains a notable gap in detailed performance investigations, particularly concerning challenging modalities such as covalent inhibitors and the emerging class of molecular glues. For the pharmaceutical industry, where real-world applications demand robust and reliable predictive capabilities, evaluating these models against those complex cases is crucial. This helps us to understand not only what co-folding models can achieve but also their current limitations that need to be improved.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this LinkedIn blog, I would like to share my first-time experience using Boltz-2 to predict the structures of two special protein-ligand complexes: a covalent kinase inhibitor and a macrocyclic molecular glue.
</p>

## Key Conclusions at the Outset

1. The co-folding model demonstrated satisfactory performance on a well-known protein target with a covalent ligand from its training set, accurately reproducing the experimental structure based on its confidence scores.

2. Generative prediction appears sensitive to different 3D inputs of the chemical component dictionary (CCD) for the same ligand. More reasonable results often come from the default or bioactive embedding.

3. For novel chemical modalities, AI models struggle to generalise and predict corresponding structures within protein complexes. The conversion of stereochemistry is a critical issue, often manifesting as "hallucinations" in the diffusion model.

4. Some improvements were observed when incorporating Gaussian denoising with physical constraints or steering potentials. This approach could yield more reasonable structures with correct ligand stereochemistry, protein complementarity, and low-energy conformations.

5. The diversity of conformational sampling remains a bottleneck for data-driven deep learning architectures. This limitation could potentially be addressed by complementing the models with physical simulations based on the energy.

## Co-folding for a Covalent Kinase Inhibitor Complex

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The first system I tested was Osimertinib, a renowned third-generation EGFR kinase covalent inhibitor clinically approved in the last decade for NSCLC patients. Several X-ray co-crystal structures for Osimertinib are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and I believe most of the latest AI co-folding models have included them in their training sets. For this study, the reference structure was taken from 6JXT, which has a 2.3 Angstrom resolution of the wild-type (WT) EGFR kinase domain (Figure 1). In this structure, the acrylamide warhead of the Osimertinib ligand has reacted with CYS-797, forming an irreversible covalent bond.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Following the standard procedure, I created the input .yaml file for the Boltz-2 modelling (Text 2). Establishing the covalent bond constraint was a bit tricky because the model workflow requires the ligand atom name index to be explicitly defined for recognition and featurisation (the SMILES string input did not work). The Boltz-2 database stores the chemical component dictionary (CCD) as a batch of RDKit molecule objects in pickle files, so I had to find the exact atom name index (i.e., C9 in this case) to define its covalency with the gamma sulfur of reactive cysteine residue in EGFR kinase domain sequence.
</div>

```
**Text 2.** The input .yaml file as example. The covalency was defined through a bond constraint.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Thanks to my new laptop with a powerful GPU (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 driven by CUDA 12.8), I was able to generate a predicted structure in about a minute using the default options and an MSA server. The first predicted model had a relatively high confidence score (0.85268) and performed quite well (Figure 3). The model aligned nicely with the co-crystal structure, reproducing both the Osimertinib ligand pose and those contacting residues in the ATP-binding pocket. The key hydrogen bond with the hinge loop was also preserved. There was only a slight difference in the solvent-exposed tertiary amine, but itâ€™s worth remembering that a crystal structure represents a static packing state, so the flexibility in solution should be expected for such a motif.
</div>

**Figure 3.** The alignment between co-crystal structure (*6JXT, ligand in pink stick*) and a predicted model from Boltz-2 (*ligand in blue stick*). The critical interaction with hinge loop was preserved by co-folding.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Then I attempted to run the prediction with more recycling steps and diffusion samples, but the GPU memory was insufficient, and my PC soon turned to a blue screen. (later on I realised the number of parallel samples need to be limited for my hardware to handle with.) Anyway I was impressed by Boltz-2's performance on co-folding this covalent system. However, one concern remained: <u>Whether the ligand's bioactive conformations, features, or properties had been "leaked" to the model? As this prediction used the default CCD data (YY3.pkl) from the Boltz repository and I saw some masked labels in it.</u> Therefore, I decided to rebuild and customise the CCD for Osimertinib using the RDKit toolkit (Figure 4) and try the co-folding again with EGFR kinase domain sequence.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
With 4 more samples from the customised Osimertinib CCD, the model produced both good and poor results. In the worst pose (Figure 5a, upper right), the N-methyl-indole fragment flipped to the wrong orientation, and the acrylamide warhead detached from the reactive cysteine. (Even visualisation software PyMOL could not recognise any covalent bond there.) Nevertheless, the model seems to be aware of its own performance, as indicated by the confidence and ligand iptm scores (Figure 5b). Those predictions with high similarity to the co-crystal structure (by ligand low RMSD under EGFR alignment) generally had better iptm scores. As a computational chemist with physical modelling background, I found these indications impressive: <u>It suggests that the combination of multiple sequence alignment (MSA), molecular topology-based GNN/MPNN, sequence language-based Transformer/Evoformer/Pairformer, and Diffusion algorithms together may be learning, deducing, and generating some real physics, not just statistics from memory.</u>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
However, the co-crystal structure of Osimertinib with EGFR was disclosed around 2020, well before the release of Boltz and other co-folding models in recent years. To test the real generalisation capability of co-folding models, more recently released novel structures would be more appropriate references.
</div>

## Co-folding for a Macrocyclic Molecular Glue Complex

<div style="text-align: justify;">
I recently saw that Isomorphic Labs referenced a KRAS G12C - cyclophilin A (CYPA) covalent molecular glue structure (PDB: 8G9Q, Figure 6 left), discovered by Revolution Medicines. They used this structure to show that their AlphaFold3 co-folding model could predict such an unseen ternary complex, though sufficient sampling was required to achieve satisfactory performance. Given that Boltz was developed after 2024, the 8G9Q structure released in 2023 should be included in its training set. (Indeed YV6 exists in the repository.) Therefore, I decided to use a more recent structure of a covalent macrocyclic molecular glue in complex with KRAS G12C - CYPA (i.e., RMC-6291 or Elironrasib, PDB 9BFX released in early 2025; Figure 6 right) to blind test the performance of Boltz-2 on this challenging modality.
</div>

<img src="/images/2025-08-30-post-images/figure6.png" alt="figure6" width="720px" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 100%;"/><br>
**Figure 6.** The covalent molecular glue for KRAS G12C (*upper domain*) and CYPA (*lower domain*). Two co-crystal structures were available respectively for a lead ligand (left, *8G9Q*) and the optimised macrocycle - Elironrasib (right, *9BFX*).

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The two protein complexes are highly identical in terms of the relative position between KRAS G12C and CYPA. The only difference lies in the ligands, where Elironrasib has a novel bridge motif that plugs onto the KRAS surface (Figure 7). I believe the scientists at Revolution Medicines must have done excellent SBDD work during lead optimisation to achieve such a macrocyclic modality, which stabilises the induced proximity between KRAS G12C and CYPA.
</div>

<img src="/images/2025-08-30-post-images/figure7a.png" alt="figure7a" width="720px" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 100%;"/><br>
<img src="/images/2025-08-30-post-images/figure7b.png" alt="figure7b" width="720px" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 100%;"/><br>
**Figure 7.** The Elironrasib-induced proximity between KRAS G12C and CYPA. Several hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic complementarities (H-bonds and salt bridges) were identified from the co-crystal structure.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For the subsequent co-folding prediction, I expected the Boltz-2 model to reproduce such ternary complex, especially for the proteins' orientation under enough sampling, since its training set contains 8G9Q. However, I was more doubtful about the AI's performance on organic macrocycles, given that chemical space is far more diverse than 20 amino acids and those cyclic peptides.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Traditionally, computational chemists would use Monte Carlo or Genetic Algorithm-based docking (rigid and ensemble) to tackle such problems, especially when there is any available or even confident holo structure (i.e., the relative orientation of the two proteins in the functional ternary complex.) for generating the grid box of receptor. Furthermore, advanced simulation techniques (e.g., enhanced MD sampling) with properly QM/DFT-parameterised force fields have been shown to reproduce NMR solution ensembles for macrocyclic drugs. These ensembles often include bioactive-like poses because the ring can constrain the dynamics of molecule into a narrow energy landscape, even without any receptor embraced. With above background, I was keen to see how an AI diffusion model would generate structures under circumstances where not much physics has been learned in this field.
</p>

### Ligand Preparation and Protein Performance

To introduce diversity, I customised three different CCD objects for Elironrasib, ensuring each entry has correctly defined stereochemistry (**Figure 8a**). Diverse strategies were used to create the 3D input pickle files for same ligand (**Figure 8b**):
1. A random conformer
2. Few low-energy conformers (*from 1000 steps of ETKDG search followed by MMFF minimisations*)
3. The bioactive conformer (*extracted from 9BFX and minimised to recover warhead geometry*)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Notably the bioactive conformer with local minimisation was calculated to be a low-energy state by classic Merck molecular force field (MMFF), even more stable than those minima sampled from ETKDG algorithm.
</p>

**Figure 8b.** Three different CCD entries of Elironrasib were used for the co-folding predictions of ternary complex, each possess a unique 3D conformer based on all correct stereochemistry. (*Error note: all energy units should be **kcal/mol** in this figure*)

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Based on 5 diffusion samples from each ligand entry (15 in total), most of the co-folding results for this ternary complex were acceptable using DockQ criteria
 (> 0.23) when evaluated for the protein-protein interface compared to the ground truth (Figure 9). One predicted pose even reached to a medium quality (DockQ > 0.49) and was given the highest confidence score by the model. However, there was no obvious correlation between DockQ and the modelâ€™s protein iptm scores. I assume this is likely due to DockQ's inability to recognise the ligand's role as a "glue" in this three-body system when evaluating small molecule docking poses.

## The Performance on Novel Macrocyclic Ligand

### Imperfect Generalisation and Problematic Stereochemistry

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Unfortunately, the model's performance on the chemical ligand itself was not as good as on protein receptors. The co-folding struggled to predict the most crucial regions where it was expected to generalize in this novel chemical space according to physical rules. If all ternary models are aligned by CYPA (mechanistically the first protein recruited and bound by Elironrasib as glue), the ligand geometries deteriorate as they approach the KRAS surface (Figure 9). This is even more apparent when aligning by KRAS, the subsequent target under induced covalency.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Out of 15 diffused samples, up to 8 ligand poses had the wrong chiral centres on the substituted morpholine ring (Figure 10a). This is the novel bridging moiety close to KRAS that was not present in the 8G9Q structure from the training set. For the remaining 7 poses with all correct stereocentres, none of their bi-aryl torsions were sampled properly. Again, this moiety was not in 8G9Q.
</p>

<img src="/images/2025-08-30-post-images/figure10a.png" alt="figure10a" width="720px" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 100%;"/><br>

**Figure 10b.** Remaining 7 co-folding samples with correct stereochemistry. All modelsâ€™ bi-aryl torsional profile is different from the experimental structure.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
To assess their physical validity, I minimised all ligand poses with correct stereochemistry using MMFF and then the semi-empirical xTB method (Table 1). Such physics-based computational results suggest that none of the generated ligand models had energies lower than the bioactive one. However, this ligand-based evaluation might be unfair to the co-folding model because most deep learning architectures use attention mechanisms on fingerprint features of intermolecular interactions rather than internal conformations. In my opinion, it is challenging to embed and normalise small-molecule conformers with any regular pairwise carbon distance constraint matrix in 2D (generally as what applicable only for mapping bio-molecular backbone network) due to their complex chemical topology and structural diversity. Therefore, co-folding models might have better performance and generalisation from the perspective of induced fit with receptors. Indeed, I have not observed any serious intermolecular clashes within these models. There are also several publicly available tools (e.g., PoseBusters) that are able to quantitatively evaluate the validity of receptor-ligand interactions for generative models, which I would not share much detail in this article.

### Use Potentials for Improving Performance on Ligand 

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The co-folding for Elironrasib in a binary complex with only CYPA was also tested, but "hallucination" became an even more serious issue. None of the models generated the correct ligand stereochemistry. To solve this, I have to add the â€˜--use_potentialsâ€™ argument, a function in the latest Boltz-2x version designed to steer the diffusion process toward more physically plausible states. This function somehow reduced the hallucination in terms of ligand stereochemistry: now 25 correct models were generated from 175 samples. Interestingly, all 25 reasonable poses were generated from the CCD that was embedded with the bioactive conformation. In other words, the model failed to produce correct stereochemistry from those CCD based on "blind" conformations, which would be the case in a real prediction scenario.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Even for those poses that passed the stereochemistry check, their bi-aryl torsional distribution was still very different from what is seen in the bioactive state of the ternary product (Figure 11a left). Among the 25 generated conformations, only one model had a dihedral angle close to the bioactive state (Figure 11a right). One could argue that a ligand's binary conformation might differ from its ternary conformation (think about tricky linkerology in hetero-bifunctional molecules), but energy calculations suggest that none of the Elironrasib poses generated with CYPA is more stable than the bioactive reference (Figure 11b left). Given the poor diversity of diffused ligand geometries (most pairs have an aligned RMSD < 1.5 Ã…; Figure 11b right), I think the mechanism hypothesis on Elironrasib as a molecular glue is better to be validated with physical simulations and biophysical experiments.
</p>

**Figure 11a.** The co-folding models for Elironrasib (*blue stick*) with CYPA (*green cartoon*) under enhanced sampling (--recycling\_steps 10 --diffusion\_samples 25 for each of 7 customised CCD). Only 1 stereo-correct model has the bi-aryl torsion approaching bioactive state (*yellow stick*).

**Figure 11b.** The heatmap of energies and geometries for Elironrasib ligand co-folded within CYPA binary complex. (*The bioactive state also include as index 0.*)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Then I added the â€˜--use_potentialsâ€™ function for the generation of ternary complex this time. To my surprise, up to 32 of the 35 Elironrasib samples now have all correct stereochemistry (Recall that only 7 of 15 generated conformations were reasonable without using such physical constraint.) and those correct poses came from various ligand CCD sources. <u>This indicated that the co-folding becomes less sensitive to the input ligand in the presence of more endogenous receptors, which also supported the previous hypothesis that pre-trained models, likely due to their Pairformer architectures, generally prioritise features related to intermolecular recognition over intrinsic physical rules.</u>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Although all generated Elironrasib models had different bi-aryl torsions and showed inferior protein complementarity (in terms of buried solvent-accessible surface area or SASA) compared to the co-crystal structure (Figure 12), some ligand conformations were calculated to be more stable than the bioactive state, based on MMFF-xTB energy minimisations. Given more time, I would also use physics-based methods such as Rosetta, Amber, MMGBSA/PBSA, or FEP to calculate protein-ligand complex and interaction energies. This would allow for a more thorough evaluation of the co-folding model's performance and provide a way to rescue/refine AI-generated structures under physiological conditions (e.g., solvation with water).
</p>

<img src="/images/2025-08-30-post-images/figure12.png" alt="figure12" width="720px" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 100%;"/><br>
**Figure 12.** The co-folding performance on ternary complex with â€˜-use\_potentialsâ€™ function in the latest Boltz-2x version. All generated ligand models (*pink stick*) are analogous and different from the Elironrasib structure (*yellow stick*) crystallised with CYPA (*green cartoon*) and KRAS (*blue cartoon*) in 9BFX. The solvent accessible surface area (SASA) was calculated by PyMOL with settings: dot\_solvent 1, solvent\_radius 1.4 and dot\_density 4.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Nevertheless, I tested the latest Boltz-2x to model free Elironrasib conformations without any protein sequence. While this is not what the co-folding model is designed for, I was curious to see how it would generate structures in pure chemical space. As expected, all conformations with correct stereochemistry were only produced from the CCD with bioactive embedding. (Same phenomenon as observed in the previous co-folding test for CYPA binary complex.) Herein, the diffusion model yield some low-energy conformers after MMFF-xTB minimisations, but the overall geometries lacked diversity according to cluster analysis â€“ most generated structures belong to the same cluster (Figure 13).

## Outlook

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Given still limited data availability, I believe that classic statistical mechanics (e.g., MCMC with Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, enhanced MD with Hamiltonian replica exchange) based on the Boltzmann principle (physical probability derived from energy) are still necessary solutions for molecular modelling tasks, particularly for most novel structures and modalities in the universe of chemical space. We are also seeing a growing influence and benefit from AI and machine learning force fields (e.g., interatomic neural network potentials) in the simulation area. By direct learning from ab initio QM/DFT datasets, these fundamental energy-based models have become another popular approach in CADD research. This could be the topic of my next blog post, if you'd like to follow me!
